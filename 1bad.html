<h1>Starting in 2025 the west (just America if we are saying the truth) moved its agdenda to take over the rest of the world as we knew it. 
    Using forged documents and our connection with other contries we abused our power and allies to take over Europe.
Later Asia and russia getting chipped away bit by bit. 
Only winning by a hair, due to the anger of the people living there, as goverments have abused them and their rights for too long.
The people pass the point of wanting to support nationalisim and fighting for there homes. 
The US moves south trying to conquer more.
After this move all governmmet, soilders, and people the world was run down. </h1>
